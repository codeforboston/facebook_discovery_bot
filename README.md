# Facebook Discovery Bot

The goal of this Facebook bot is to facilitate access to legal immigration information to the undocumented community here in the Boston area. The Facebook bot will answer questions asked by users and provide links to external sources where they can gather more information. We want the bot to answer a variety of different questions ranging from what to do when a family member is detained by an ICE agent, deportation notices, travel bans, links to advocacy groups and more. By providing the community with legal information we hope to ensure that their rights are protected and that immigration officials do not overstep their legal power.

# Data

Since we are setting the scope of use for this Facebook bot to the Boston area, we will be using the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA) website as our main source of legal information. Eventually we want to work on expanding our sources and developing an easy (automated) way to gather and generate this data.

# Development

We will implement Facebookâ€™s APIs (Messenger Platform) and API.AI for natural language processing. Server side code will be written in Node.js and will be deployed on Heroku or AWS.
